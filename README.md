### Project Description

I am interested in designing an interactive map that reveals [glacier loss in Glacier National Park, Montana](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/retreat-glaciers-glacier-national-park?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects). The USGS has been documenting glacier area loss within the Park since 1966 using aerial and satellite imagery. Datasets of digitized polygons of glacier outlines exist for 1966, 1998, 2005 and 2015. Additionally, a maximum glacier extent dataset exists from the mid-19th century Little Ice Age (LIA) based on terminal moraine locations. The USGS and NPS also have a rich collection of historical photographs, including a repeat photography project that will be incorporated into the web map.

### State of Data

Developing an interactive map that displays glacier loss is a clear and poignant indicator of climate change that is occuring now, and in this country.

### Datasets

* [USGS Glacier extent polygon datasets (1966 - 2015)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542)

* [USGS Little Ice Age polygon dataset](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b194f1ce4b092d965237f5f)

* [USGS Repeat photography Project](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/repeat-photography-project?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

* 1966 - 2015 localized to individual glacier (4km spatial resolution) climatological data queried and extracted from [Oregon State University Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering, Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)](http://prism.oregonstate.edu/)
